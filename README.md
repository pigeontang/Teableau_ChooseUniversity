Using Tableau, the project uses visualizations to help U.S. high school students who are ready to enter college choose their target schools. The project analyzes and visualizes data on crime rates, tuition, racial ratios, awards, and admissions rates to make recommendations for students with different needs. Ultimately using a dashboard to aggregate and present this data, the dashboard helps students quickly find their target schools and compare them. The project also uses dynamic visualizations to display data from the past three years. For example, acceptance and graduation rates over the past three years will be an important consideration for some students. By using dynamic visualizations, traditional data can show these changes faster and more visually, helping students choose the colleges that are best for them.
